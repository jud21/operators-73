<h1 style="color:blue; font-family:Trattatello; text-align:center;">Welcome to JD's FIRST SITE</h1>

<h2 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">My Background</h2>

<p>I grew about 15 miles west of Chicago in a suburb called Western Springs, and attended Lyons Township High School.  Afterwards, I spent one year at The University of Wisconsin - Whitewater before leaving to run a car dealership supply service that I had started in my spare time.  Through my grandfather's guidance and a lot of time on the internet I got into day trading, and eventually transitioned from traditional markets into cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to get far too invested in the success of my favorite sports teams: Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, Chicago Blackhawks, Arsenal.  Yeah, I know they're all trash right now.  I grew up playing soccer and play with some friends in a recreation league on Sundays.  I like video games, but never really outgrew my GameCube.  I like to write and am slowly chipping away at a novel.  I'm into weightlifting (but have a long way too go!!).  I am a fairly open book so if you want to know anything just ask!</p>

<p>My interest in web development has been growing steadily for a few years now, aside from just being a great talent to possess, I find it to be very complimentary to my investing work.  Many times have I encountered problems and/or ideas that I had no way of implementing on my own, having to count on my brother's development skills.  Hopefully in 10 weeks I'll have enough know how under my belt to pull my own weight!</p>
